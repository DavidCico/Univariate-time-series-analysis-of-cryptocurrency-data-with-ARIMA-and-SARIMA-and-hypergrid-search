    "# How to grid search ARIMA and SARIMA models hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In this notebook, an exmaple of grid search on ARIMA and SARIMA model parameters is proposed. This notebook is complementary of the 1st one <a href=\"https://github.com/DavidCico/Univariate-time-series-analysis-of-cryptocurrency-data-with-ARIMA-and-SARIMA-and-hypergrid-search/blob/master/Univariate_analysis_classic_methods.ipynb\">Univariate_analysis_classic_methods</a>, and follows the similar procedure in terms of data loading, definition of the testing and training sets, and also for the implementation of the ARIMA and SARIMA models. To avoid repetition, the reader should read this <a href=\"https://github.com/DavidCico/Univariate-time-series-analysis-of-cryptocurrency-data-with-ARIMA-and-SARIMA-and-hypergrid-search/blob/master/Univariate_analysis_classic_methods.ipynb\">notebook</a> first before the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The ARIMA model for time series analysis and forecasting can be tricky to configure. There are 3 parameters that require estimation by iterative trial and error from reviewing diagnostic plots and using 40-year-old heuristic rules. We can automate the process of evaluating a large number of hyperparameters for the ARIMA model by using a grid search procedure.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or SARIMA, model is an approach for modeling univariate time series data that may contain trend and seasonal components. It is an effective approach for time series forecasting, although it requires careful analysis and domain expertise in order to configure the seven or more model hyperparameters. An alternative approach to configuring the model that makes use of fast and parallel modern hardware is to grid search a suite of hyperparameter configurations in order to discover what works best. Often, this process can reveal non-intuitive model configurations that result in lower forecast error than those configurations specified through careful analysis.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In this notebook, you will discover how to develop a framework for grid searching all of the ARIMA and SARIMA model hyperparameters for univariate time series forecasting.</p>\n"

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, SARIMA or Seasonal ARIMA, is an extension of ARIMA that explicitly supports univariate time series data with a seasonal component.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">It adds three new hyperparameters to specify the autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) for the seasonal component of the series, as well as an additional parameter for the period of the seasonality.</p>\n",
    "<blockquote><p>A seasonal ARIMA model is formed by including additional seasonal terms in the ARIMA [&#8230;] The seasonal part of the model consists of terms that are very similar to the non-seasonal components of the model, but they involve backshifts of the seasonal period.</p></blockquote>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Configuring a SARIMA requires selecting hyperparameters for both the trend and seasonal elements of the series.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">There are three trend elements that require configuration.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">They are the same as the ARIMA model; specifically:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><strong>p</strong>: Trend autoregression order.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>d</strong>: Trend difference order.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>q</strong>: Trend moving average order.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">There are four seasonal elements that are not part of ARIMA that must be configured; they are:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><strong>P</strong>: Seasonal autoregressive order.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>D</strong>: Seasonal difference order.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Q</strong>: Seasonal moving average order.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>m</strong>: The number of time steps for a single seasonal period.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Together, the notation for a SARIMA model is specified as:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The SARIMA model can subsume the ARIMA, ARMA, AR, and MA models via model configuration parameters.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The trend and seasonal hyperparameters of the model can be configured by analyzing autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, and this can take some expertise.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">An alternative approach is to grid search a suite of model configurations and discover which configurations work best for a specific univariate time series.</p>"

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">We use the implementation of <a href=\"http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.arima_model.ARIMA.html\">ARIMA</a> and <a href=\"http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html\">SARIMA</a> provided by the statsmodels library.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This model has hyperparameters that control the nature of the model performed for the series, trend and seasonality, specifically:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><strong>order</strong>: A tuple p, d, and q parameters for the modeling of the trend (only parameters required for ARIMA).</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>sesonal_order</strong>: A tuple of P, D, Q, and m parameters for the modeling the seasonality</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>trend</strong>: A parameter for controlling a model of the deterministic trend as one of &#8216;n&#8217;,&#8217;c&#8217;,&#8217;t&#8217;,&#8217;ct&#8217; for no trend, constant, linear, and constant with linear trend, respectively.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">If you know enough about your problem to specify one or more of these parameters, then you should specify them. If not, you can try grid searching these parameters.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The grid search framework is defined at first in a similar way as in the <a href=\"https://github.com/DavidCico/Univariate-time-series-analysis-of-cryptocurrency-data-with-ARIMA-and-SARIMA-and-hypergrid-search/blob/master/Univariate_analysis_classic_methods.ipynb\">first notebook</a>, concerning the split of the data, the general implementation of the statistic models, as well as the evaluation metric.

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The data in a given dataset will be divided into standard weeks. These are weeks that begin on a Monday and end on a Sunday.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This is a realistic and useful way for using the chosen framing of the model, where the price for the week ahead can be predicted. It is also helpful with modeling, where models can be used to predict a specific day (e.g. Wednesday) or the entire sequence.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">We will split the data into standard weeks, working backwards from the test dataset. This gives 178 weeks of data for the training set and 102 weeks (714 days) for the testing set.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The function <em>split_dataset()</em> below splits the daily data into train and test sets and organizes each into standard weeks. The \"<i>n_test</i>\" argument corresponds to the number of days (714 in this study), to cut the data backwards.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Specific row offsets are used to split the data using knowledge of the dataset. The split datasets are then organized into weekly data using the NumPy <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.split.html\">split() function</a>.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The <em>to_series()</em> function will also take the multivariate data divided into weekly windows and will return a single univariate time series.</p>\n"
